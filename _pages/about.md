<a href="#"><b>MELLEN.AI</b></a>, founded by Mellen Y.Pu and Jiaxin Jiang in Jan 1, 2023, is a public research organization for **intelligent system developing**, including domains such as **chemistry and biology**. We mainly focus on the large data mining on *domain-structural-graph*.

Currentlly, we focus on <a href="#"><b>controllable special morphology nanosynthesis</b></a> with professional fundamental analysis and experiments. Furthermore, we deal with the challenges on both <a href="#"><b>disease mechanism discovery and biological interaction</b></a>. 

In the future, MELLEN-AI will explore more on <a href="#"><b>inorganic chemistry and life science</b></a> in the artificial intelligence perspective. Hoping there could be a well-built-ecosystem upon the cross relationship between basic science and artificial intelligence through the hard-working by us.
