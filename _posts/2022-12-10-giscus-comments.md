## Graph Neural Network (GNN)
**Quick look:**
* [Wikipedia: GNN.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network)
* [The basic graph netwrok architecture.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)
* [An introduction to the applications of GNN.](https://neptune.ai/blog/graph-neural-network-and-some-of-gnn-applications)


**My work mainly focus on:**
* Develop efficient GNNs.
* Spatiotemporal graph prediction.
* Graph Learning for stable generalization.
* Graph out-of-distribution.
* GNN's applications on biology and chemistry.
* Dynamic GNN on different conditions.
* Evolutions of the GNN.
* Graph Transformer.


## Computer Vision
**Main aspects:**
* Object Detection and Segmentation
* Single view 3D Reconstruction
* Generative models, e.g. GANs and Diffusions
* Neural Radiance Fields
